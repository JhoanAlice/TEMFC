## Architecture Improvements

### MVVM Architecture

The application now strictly follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **Models**: Data structures encapsulating relevant information
- **Views**: UI components that bind to ViewModels
- **ViewModels**: Business logic linking Models and Views

### Dependency Injection

- Implemented proper dependency injection throughout the application
- Made dependencies explicit and testable
- Eliminated tight coupling between components

### Module Separation

Decomposed large monolithic classes into focused, single-responsibility modules:

- **DataManager** split into:
  - `ExamLoader`: Handles exam file loading
  - `PersistenceManager`: Manages data persistence
  - `CacheManager`: Optimizes in-memory caching
  - `DiagnosticsManager`: Handles diagnostics/logging

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure

```
/TEMFC
├── Models          # Core data models
├── ViewModels      # Business logic
│   └── DataManager     # Data management modules 
├── Views           # UI screens and components
├── Utils           # Helper utilities
│   └── DesignSystem    # Design system components
└── Resources       # Exam data and assets
```

### File Structure

- Each file focuses on a single responsibility
- Files organized by feature and function
- Related functionality grouped together

## Design System

Created a comprehensive design system to ensure UI consistency:

- **TEMFCDesign**: Core design tokens
  - Typography, colors, spacing, shadows, animations
  - Consistent modifiers for common styling needs
 
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
  - Tags, badges, progress bars, cards
  - Consistent component design across the app

## Model Enhancements

Updated the model layer to be more robust and flexible:

- **Exam and Question Models**:
  - Made models immutable where appropriate
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Improved JSON decoding with fallbacks
  - Added validation logic
  - Implemented proper Equatable conformance

- **Additional Computed Properties**:
  - Added helper properties to simplify view code
  - Improved type safety with strong typing

## View Model Refactoring

Significantly improved the ViewModels:

- **ExamViewModel**:
  - Documented public API
  - Simplified interface with clear responsibilities
  - Added proper property access control
  - Improved performance with computed properties
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Extracted complex business logic into helper methods

- **DataManager**:
  - Split into specialized components
  - Improved file loading algorithm
  - Enhanced caching strategy
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Added diagnostic tools

## Performance Optimizations

Several performance improvements were implemented:

- **Memory Management**:
  - More efficient caching strategy
  - Better resource cleanup
  - Reduced memory footprint

- **Concurrency**:
  - Improved background loading with GCD
  - Parallel file processing
  - Better UI responsiveness during data operations

- **Data Loading**:
  - Optimized JSON processing
  - Improved file search algorithms
  - Fallback mechanisms for resilience

## Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase:

- **Code Comments**:
  - Documented public API with proper documentation comments
  - Explained complex algorithms
  - Clarified business logic

- **Project Documentation**:
  - Added README.md with project overview
  - Created this REFACTORING.md document
  - Documented JSON format for exams
